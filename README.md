# lasse-py
Python code used at LASSE / UFPA projects concerning signal processing, machine learning, digital communications, etc.

## Installation for users

Make sure your Python environment has all dependencies using:

conda install --file requirements.txt

If you do not have an environment yet, it is a good idea to follow the hints at https://github.com/lasseufpa/python_template and install one.

## Guidelines for developers

### Install tools for commiting code

TO-DO IMPROVE HERE

https://guicommits.com/organize-python-code-like-a-pro/

### To update the requirements.txt file 

We use:

pip install pipreqs

And from the project folder:

pipreqs .

(which will parse the files and save a new requirements.txt. You may move it if the file already exists)

## Extra information and packages we adopt

https://github.com/librosa/librosa - audio and music analysis

https://github.com/keunwoochoi/kapre - for processing audio in GPU when using Keras

https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/signal.html - signal processing

https://github.com/crflynn/stochastic - stochastic (random) processes

### Regarding audio I/O

We need to evaluate code to record and play sound:

https://github.com/spatialaudio/python-sounddevice/ - bindings for the PortAudio library and a few convenience functions to play and record NumPy arrays containing audio signals

https://github.com/PortAudio/portaudio - audio I/O library in C that runs on Windows, Mac and Linux

### Regarding telecom

We need to evaluate taking in account a good class definition for signals to be used in PHY simulations:
